ROSE 3.0
========

Synopsis
----
ROSE is a browser extension for researchers to capture in situ data on how users actually use online social networks.

[Please see the project page for more detailed information.](https://secure-software-engineering.github.io/rose/index.html)

Features
----
* Currently supported social network sites: facebook.com, (experimental: reddit.com)
* Capturing user interactions such as likes, unlikes, comments, sending chat messages or sharing content.
* Capturing addtional information about the content users interacting with (e.g. posts, sharer, etc.)
* Capturing user activity by mouse move distance, scroll distance, OSN tab focus time, click amount and login status
* Comment function enables study participants to comment on their own or others' actions right in the OSN
* Privacy by Design: With the ROSE control center study participants have full control over the data collected. No shared content such as chat messages or images is collected. Captured events have privacy-respecting identifiers to correlate them among study participants (if required), and to relate events and comments. ROSE's privacy-aware design aims on minimizing interferences with the field.
* Easy to adopt to changes in the structure of OSNs or even add new sites by standardized observer definitions with push update functionality
* Bilingual: English(US) and German(DE)
* Cross-browser compatibility through the [Kango - Cross-browser extension framework](http://kangoextensions.com/)

Build
-----

To build ROSE you need `node, npm, bower, ember-cli and gulp` installed. You can build your own copy of ROSE with the following steps

1. Install dependencies with `npm`
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    During install you may get asked a few questions. Just choose the defaults. If progress is halted just press return once.

2. Build ROSE UI based on Ember (You can skip this step. A precompiled version is in the repository)
    ```
    cd rui/
    npm install
    bower install
    ember build
    cd ..
    ```

3. Build packages for Chrome, Firefox and Safari with Kango
    ```
    gulp build
    ```

During development you can make use of watch processes:

1. Rebuild UI with watch in `rui/`
    ```
    ember build -w
    ````

2. Rebuild ROSE with watch and reload
    ```
    gulp
    ```
