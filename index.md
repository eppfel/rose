## Welcome to ROSE - The Research Tool for Online Social Environments -

These pages try to answer the most common question around ROSE.


### What is ROSE?

ROSE is basically a web browser add-on for Google Chrome, Mac OS X Safari, and Mozilla Firefox that allows empirical researchers to collect data on how participants in user studies use websites such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google+. While this is the main purpose of ROSE, the software also implements a complete online research workflow including creating a study with ROSE, deploying a tailored ROSE configuration to participants, and analyzing collected data.

### So ROSE basically counts clicks in Facebook? That's simple, isn't it?

While it sounds easy to collect field data the evil is in the details: first of all, any data collection needs to balance study participants' privacy interests and the level of detail of the data collection. Second, web pages such as Facebook or Google+ are constantly changing their design and structure making it technically difficult to observe defined events. Hence any data collection tool must be able to adopt to these changes easily and in time.

We developed ROSE within our own empirical studies of interactional privacy on social network sites. We revised ROSE with any new requirement we found in our work hence it crystallizes years of experience in doing multi-method empirical research
